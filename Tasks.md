Inital Plan
    - My inital plan is to walk through the html and change outstanding problems/issues
    - The next script to chack is the CSS Code and chage issues and list thoes changes and tinker with values for the site
    - after css I plan on adding the js which I'll make comments for anything outstanding/aproached differently
